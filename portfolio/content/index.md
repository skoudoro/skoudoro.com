<div style="text-align: center;">Wow, I am glad you made it until here! Time for fun stuff.</div></br>

- I'm married with an amazing wife named Telesilla and proud dad of 2 young kiddos (Helio & )
- I played basketball for a long time. I was also basketball coach for many years (10+)
- In general, I'm big into sports, it is crazy what a human body can do!
- Living in USA, french, grow up in France, spend a lot of summer in benin, greek by adoption (I need to lear, I do not understand my kids when they talk to my wife ðŸ˜…)
- I love travelling, and I love even more the expat feeling.
- I have Sickle Cell Disease and I manage it pretty well! Strange that it is so unknown when it is the most common form of an inherited blood disorder worldwide.</br></br>

<div style="text-align: center;">OK, well thatâ€™s all for nowâ€¦</div>
