**Wow, I am glad you made it until here! Time for fun stuff.**

- I'm married with an amazing wife named Telesilla and proud dad of 2 young kiddos (Helio & Seleny)
- I played basketball for a long time. I was also basketball coach for many years (10+)
- In general, I'm big into sports, it is crazy what a human body can do!
- Living in USA, french, grow up in France, spend a lot of summer in benin, greek by adoption (I need to learn, I do not understand my kids when they talk to my wife ðŸ˜…)
- I love travelling, and I love even more the expat feeling.
- I have Sickle Cell Disease and I manage it pretty well! Strange that it is so unknown when it is the most common form of an inherited blood disorder worldwide.

**OK, well that's all for nowâ€¦ Below some personal activities**
